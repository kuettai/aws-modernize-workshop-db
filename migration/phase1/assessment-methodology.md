# Phase 1: Assessment Methodology
## SQL Server to AWS RDS SQL Server Migration

### 🎯 Assessment Objectives
- Evaluate current SQL Server environment for RDS compatibility
- Identify migration blockers and requirements
- Establish performance baselines
- Calculate migration effort and timeline

### 📊 Current Environment Analysis

#### System Information Collection
```sql
-- Run on current SQL Server instance
SELECT 
    @@VERSION as SQLServerVersion,
    @@SERVERNAME as ServerName,
    SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') as Edition,
    SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') as ServicePack,
    SERVERPROPERTY('Collation') as Collation
```

#### Database Size Assessment
```sql
-- Database size and growth patterns
SELECT 
    DB_NAME(database_id) as DatabaseName,
    type_desc as FileType,
    size * 8 / 1024 as SizeMB,
    growth as GrowthSetting,
    is_percent_growth as IsPercentGrowth
FROM sys.master_files 
WHERE database_id = DB_ID('LoanApplicationDB')
```

### 🔍 Compatibility Assessment

#### Feature Compatibility Check
| Feature | Current Usage | RDS Compatibility | Action Required |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| SQL Server Agent | Not Used | ✅ Supported | None |
| CLR Integration | Not Used | ✅ Supported | None |
| Service Broker | Not Used | ✅ Supported | None |
| Full-Text Search | Not Used | ✅ Supported | None |
| Stored Procedures | ✅ Used (4 procedures) | ✅ Supported | Test functionality |
| T-SQL Features | ✅ Standard T-SQL | ✅ Supported | None |

### 🎯 RDS Sizing Recommendations

#### Instance Class Selection
Based on current workload analysis:

| Metric | Current Value | RDS Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| CPU Usage | < 20% average | db.t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) |
| Memory Usage | < 2GB | Sufficient for workload |
| Storage | ~5GB data + logs | 20GB GP2 with auto-scaling |
| IOPS | < 1000 | GP2 baseline sufficient |

#### Cost Estimation
```
Monthly Cost Estimate (us-east-1):
- db.t3.medium: ~$58/month
- 20GB GP2 Storage: ~$2.30/month
- Backup Storage: ~$1/month (estimated)
Total: ~$61.30/month
```

### ⚠️ Risk Assessment

#### Low Risk Items
- ✅ Standard T-SQL compatibility
- ✅ No deprecated features used
- ✅ Simple stored procedures
- ✅ Standard data types

#### Medium Risk Items
- ⚠️ Complex stored procedure with cursors and temp tables
- ⚠️ Application connection string changes
- ⚠️ Backup/restore process changes

#### Migration Blockers
- ❌ None identified for RDS SQL Server

### 📋 Pre-Migration Checklist

#### Technical Preparation
- [ ] Document current connection strings
- [ ] Export database schema scripts
- [ ] Create full database backup
- [ ] Test stored procedures functionality
- [ ] Document application dependencies

#### AWS Environment Preparation
- [ ] AWS account with appropriate permissions
- [ ] VPC and security group configuration
- [ ] Parameter group customization
- [ ] Backup retention policy definition

### 🎯 Success Criteria

#### Functional Requirements
- All stored procedures execute without errors
- Application connects successfully
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- Data integrity maintained

#### Performance Requirements
- Query response times within 10% of baseline
- Connection establishment < 2 seconds
- No application timeouts or errors
