# Phase 2: Post-Migration Validation
## PostgreSQL Migration Validation and Reporting Script Execution

### 🎯 Validation Objectives
- Verify data integrity after DMS migration
- Execute converted PostgreSQL reporting scripts
- Compare results with SQL Server baseline
- Performance benchmarking on Aurora PostgreSQL

### 📋 Prerequisites
- DMS migration completed successfully
- Aurora PostgreSQL cluster accessible
- Converted PostgreSQL reporting scripts available
- Baseline SQL Server results for comparison

### 🔍 Data Integrity Validation

#### Comprehensive Row Count Validation
```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Comprehensive table validation
WITH table_counts AS (
    SELECT 'applications' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM applications
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'customers', COUNT(*) FROM customers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'loans', COUNT(*) FROM loans
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'payments', COUNT(*) FROM payments
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'documents', COUNT(*) FROM documents
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'creditchecks', COUNT(*) FROM creditchecks
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'integrationlogs', COUNT(*) FROM integrationlogs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'branches', COUNT(*) FROM branches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'loanofficers', COUNT(*) FROM loanofficers
),
expected_counts AS (
    SELECT 'applications' as table_name, 200000 as expected_count
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'customers', 50000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'loans', 180000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'payments', 500000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'documents', 300000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'creditchecks', 150000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'integrationlogs', 1000000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'branches', 50
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'loanofficers', 200
)
SELECT 
    tc.table_name,
    tc.row_count as actual_count,
    ec.expected_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN tc.row_count = ec.expected_count THEN '✅ PASS'
        ELSE '❌ FAIL'
    END as validation_status,
    CASE 
        WHEN ec.expected_count > 0 THEN 
            ROUND((tc.row_count::numeric / ec.expected_count::numeric) * 100, 2)
        ELSE 0 
    END as completion_percentage
FROM table_counts tc
JOIN expected_counts ec ON tc.table_name = ec.table_name
ORDER BY tc.table_name;
```

#### Data Type and Constraint Validation
```sql
-- Verify data types converted correctly

    is_nullable,
    column_default

WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name IN ('applications', 'customers', 'loans', 'payments')
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- Verify primary keys and indexes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Verify foreign key constraints
SELECT
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY tc.table_name, kcu.column_name;
```

### 🚀 Next Steps

Upon successful validation:

1. **Update Application Configuration**
   - Modify connection strings to point to Aurora PostgreSQL
   - Update Entity Framework provider to Npgsql
   - Test application functionality

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze query execution plans
   - Optimize indexes based on usage patterns
   - Configure connection pooling

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure CloudWatch monitoring
   - Set up performance alerts
   - Implement health checks

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Document any schema differences
   - Update operational procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guides

**Phase 2 validation is now complete and ready for Phase 3 DynamoDB integration!**
