# Step 5: Application Integration
## Phase 3: DynamoDB Migration - Complete Application Updates

### üéØ Objective
Update the loan application to use the hybrid logging service and complete the migration to DynamoDB with proper monitoring and validation.

### üìö Learning Examples

#### Example 1: Enhanced Controller with Hybrid Logging
```csharp
using LoanApplication.Services;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace LoanApplication.Controllers
{
    public class DocsController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IHybridLogService _hybridLogService;
        
        public DocsController(IHybridLogService hybridLogService)
        {
            _hybridLogService = hybridLogService;
        }
        
        public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
        {
            var stats = new
            {
                IntegrationLogs = await _hybridLogService.GetLogCountAsync(),
                MigrationPhase = GetCurrentMigrationPhase()
            };
            
            return View(stats);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Service Integration with Logging
```csharp
public class CreditCheckService : ICreditCheckService
{
    private readonly IHybridLogService _logService;
    
    public async Task<CreditCheckResult> CheckCreditAsync(int customerId, decimal loanAmount)
    {
        var requestLog = new IntegrationLog
        {
            LogType = "API",
            ServiceName = "CreditCheckService",
            LogTimestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
            CorrelationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
        };
        
        await _logService.WriteLogAsync(requestLog);
        
        // Business logic here...
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### üìÅ Copy Complete Application Integration

All integration files have been pre-created. Copy the complete updated application:

```powershell
# Copy updated controllers
copy migration\phase3\LoanApplication-05\Controllers\DocsController.cs LoanApplication\Controllers\
copy migration\phase3\LoanApplication-05\Controllers\MigrationDashboardController.cs LoanApplication\Controllers\

# Copy updated services
copy migration\phase3\LoanApplication-05\Services\CreditCheckService.cs LoanApplication\Services\
copy migration\phase3\LoanApplication-05\Services\ICreditCheckService.cs LoanApplication\Services\

# Copy updated views
copy migration\phase3\LoanApplication-05\Views\Docs\Index.cshtml LoanApplication\Views\Docs\
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Update Configuration

Add to appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "HybridLogging": {
    "WritesToSql": true,
    "WritesToDynamoDb": true,
    "ReadsFromDynamoDb": true,
    "CurrentPhase": "Phase2"
  }
}
```

### üîß Verify Program.cs

Ensure these services are already registered in your Program.cs (they should be from the baseline application):
```csharp
// These should already exist:
builder.Services.AddScoped<ICreditCheckService, CreditCheckService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<ILoanService, LoanService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IDSRCalculationService, DSRCalculationService>();
```

**Note**: No changes needed to Program.cs - these services are already registered.

### üß™ Test Complete Integration

```powershell
# Build and run the updated application
cd LoanApplication
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Test migration dashboard endpoints
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/MigrationDashboard/status
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/MigrationDashboard/health
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/MigrationDashboard/metrics

# Test validation
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/MigrationDashboard/validate -Method POST
```

### üìä Migration Dashboard Features

1. **Real-time Status**: Current migration phase and configuration
2. **Health Monitoring**: PostgreSQL and DynamoDB connectivity checks
3. **Data Validation**: Consistency checks between data sources
4. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
5. **Migration Controls**: Phase transitions and testing tools

### üöÄ Complete Migration Workflow

#### Phase Transitions
1. **Enable Dual Write**: Start writing to both PostgreSQL and DynamoDB
2. **Switch to DynamoDB Reads**: Read from DynamoDB while still dual-writing
3. **Disable SQL Writes**: Complete migration to DynamoDB only
4. **Validate and Monitor**: Continuous validation and performance monitoring

#### Safety Features
- Each phase can be reversed via configuration
- Data validation at each step
- Health checks for both data sources
- Rollback procedures documented

### üí° Q Developer Integration Points

```
1. "Review this complete application integration and suggest improvements for monitoring, error handling, and user experience during migration."

2. "Analyze the migration workflow and recommend additional safety measures and validation steps for production deployment."

3. "Examine the dashboard implementation and suggest enhancements for real-time monitoring and alerting during the migration process."
