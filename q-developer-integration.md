   Expected Q Response: Provides SQL scripts or SSMS steps to export schema
   
   Step 3 - Schema Analysis Prompt:
   "Here is my exported database schema from export-schema.sql. Please analyze this for AWS RDS SQL Server migration readiness. Identify any compatibility issues, optimization opportunities, and migration complexity."
   
   [Paste database schema content]
   
   Expected Q Response: Detailed compatibility analysis, risk assessment, recommendations
   ```

2. **Migration Strategy Discovery**
   ```
   Step 1 - Discovery Prompt:
   "I need to migrate a SQL Server database from on-premises to AWS RDS SQL Server. The database is about 5GB with 200K+ records. What are the recommended migration approaches and their trade-offs?"
   
   Expected Q Response: Explains backup/restore via S3, DMS options, pros/cons
   
   Step 2 - Method Selection Prompt:
   "Based on your recommendations, I want to use the backup and restore method via S3. Walk me through the high-level steps and what AWS services I'll need."
   
   Expected Q Response: Outlines S3 bucket, backup process, RDS restore procedure
   
   Step 3 - Implementation Prompt:
   "Great! Now generate the PowerShell scripts for this backup-to-S3-to-RDS migration approach. Include error handling, progress monitoring, and validation steps."
   
   Alternative Step 3 - CloudShell Prompt:
   "Generate AWS CLI commands that I can run in CloudShell to perform this migration. Include S3 operations and RDS restore commands."
   ```

3. **Performance Baseline Discovery**
   ```
   Step 1 - Understanding Baselines:
   "I'm about to migrate my SQL Server database to RDS. Why is establishing performance baselines important, and what metrics should I capture before migration?"
   
   Expected Q Response: Explains importance of baselines, key metrics (query time, CPU, memory, I/O)
   
   Step 2 - Baseline Strategy:
   "What's the best approach to capture comprehensive performance baselines for a loan application database with high transaction volume? What tools and queries should I use?"
   
   Expected Q Response: Recommends SQL Server DMVs, performance counters, query execution plans
   
   Step 3 - Implementation Request:
   "Generate SQL queries to establish performance baselines for my database migration validation. Focus on query execution time, resource usage, connection metrics, and key business queries for a loan application system."
   
   Expected Q Response: Specific SQL scripts for baseline measurement
   ```

4. **Application Configuration Discovery**
   ```
   Step 1 - Configuration Impact Assessment:
   "After migrating my database to RDS, what changes do I need to make to my .NET application configuration? What are the potential issues I should watch out for?"
   
   Expected Q Response: Explains connection string changes, security considerations, performance implications
   
   Step 2 - Configuration Strategy:
   "My .NET application currently connects to localhost SQL Server. What's the best practice for updating connection strings for RDS? Should I use different configurations for development vs production?"
   
   Expected Q Response: Recommends configuration patterns, environment-specific settings, security best practices
   
   Step 3 - Implementation Request:
   "Here's my current appsettings.json configuration. Update this to connect to AWS RDS SQL Server instead of localhost. Include proper security settings and connection pooling for production use."
   
   [Paste current appsettings.json]
   
   Expected Q Response: Updated configuration with RDS endpoint, security settings, best practices
   ```

#### Phase 2: PostgreSQL Conversion

**Q Developer Use Cases:**

   [Paste stored procedure code]
   ```

2. **Entity Framework Provider Update**
   ```
   Q Prompt: "Update this Entity Framework DbContext from SQL Server to PostgreSQL. Show the necessary package changes, connection string format, and any code modifications needed."
   
   [Paste DbContext code]
   ```

3. **Data Type Mapping Analysis**
   ```
   Q Prompt: "Analyze these SQL Server data types and provide PostgreSQL equivalents. Highlight any potential data loss or precision issues."
   
   SQL Server Types:
   - NVARCHAR(MAX)
   - DATETIME2
   - UNIQUEIDENTIFIER
   - DECIMAL(12,2)
   - BIT
   ```

   [Paste complex stored procedure]
   ```

#### Phase 3: DynamoDB Integration

**Q Developer Use Cases:**
1. **NoSQL Data Model Design**
   ```
   Q Prompt: "Design a DynamoDB table structure for this high-volume logging data. Recommend partition key, sort key, and access patterns for time-series queries."
   
   Current SQL Table:
   - LogId (INT IDENTITY)
